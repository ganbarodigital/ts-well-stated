# Welcome To @ganbarodigital/well-stated!

## Introduction

_WellStated_ is a type-safe state store, inspired by Flux, Redux and Vuex. It's built to support both CLI and API applications.

It is very much a work-in-progress at this point.

## Quick Start

```
# run this from your Terminal
npm install @ganbarodigital/well-stated
```

```typescript
// add this import to your Typescript code
import { Store } from "@ganbarodigital/well-stated/lib/v1"
```

__VS Code users:__ once you've added a single import anywhere in your project, you'll then be able to auto-import anything else that this library exports.
